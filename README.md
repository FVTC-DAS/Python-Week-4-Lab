# Python Week 4 Lab: Conditional Logic

This repository contains the starter notebook for the Week 4 Lab. You will practice conditional logic, logical operators, and user input.

## Files
- `week4_lab.ipynb` — Your lab notebook. Follow the Markdown instructions and complete the code cells.

## Getting Started
1. Open this repository in **VS Code**
2. Open `week4_lab.ipynb`.
3. Complete **Task 1–3** in the blank code cells provided.
4. Run your code with different values to test your logic.

## Tasks (Summary)
- **Task 1: Age Group Classifier** — Use `if/elif/else` to categorize an `age` value.
- **Task 2: Login Simulator** — Check a username/password pair using `and`.
- **Task 3: Even or Odd** — Determine parity using the modulo operator `%`.

## Submission
1. Save your notebook.
2. In VS Code, open the **Source Control** panel.
3. **Stage** your changes, **commit** with a message like `feat: Complete Week 4 lab`, and **sync/push**.
4. Submit your repository link on **Blackboard**.

## Troubleshooting
- If `input()` doesn’t work in your environment, run the notebook using **Jupyter** instead of certain web-based viewers.
- If your notebook doesn’t appear to run, ensure the **Python** kernel is selected (e.g., *Python 3*).

Good luck, and have fun practicing conditional logic!
